Sports analytics for football clubs and analysts can offer tactical insights, optimize player performance analysis, and improve decision-making using match and player data.

Project Idea: 
* Use the StatsBomb Open Data to study player and team performances. 
* Build a data pipeline to ingest player and match data, clean it for inconsistencies, and transform it for analysis. 
* Load raw data into Google Cloud Storage(use s3 bucket), preprocess it using Mage VM(EC2), and store results in BigQuery(Redshift). 
* Create dashboards in Looker(Quicksight) to visualize team strategies, player efficiency, and game outcomes. 
* Focus on metrics like ball possession, player heatmaps, passes, and shots. 
* Create dashboards to visualize game highlights, team strengths, and individual player contributions.(Quicksights)
